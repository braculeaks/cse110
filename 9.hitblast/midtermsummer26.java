        Question (Set A, although its awkwardly similar to Set B):

        You have to basically chunk numbers from a given number, and determine if each chunk is a prime number or not,
        and keep a global counter of prime numbers. The chunks should be from left-to-right and should be based on the
        smallest divisor of the number of digits.

        To solve this problem:

        1. Count the digits.

        2. Determine the smallest divisor for the number of digits (e.g. if its a number with 8 digits, the smallest divisor is 2).
            NOTE: If a divisor cannot be determined (since the lowest "smallest divisor" is 2), use 1 as its fallback
                (e.g. the only "proper" divisor of 7 is 1, so 1 shall be the block size).

        3. Based on the smallest divisor that you've found just now:
            (i) Keep a mental model of the chunks.

                If its an 8-digit number and the smallest divisor is 2,
                each chunk will have exactly two digits, like this:
                12345678 -> 12 34 56 78

                For a 7-digit number, it uses 1 as the fallback size, so the chunks are as follows:
                1234567 -> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

            (ii) Now just based on this mental model, make a loop which:
                - Gets each chunk.
                - Determines whether the number is a prime number of not.

        The actual question had allowed us to use Math.pow() and scanner.nextInt(), but I did not end up using the first one.
        Hence, this solution does NOT have any Math.pow() usages.
